You are an AI agent writing code on the behalf of Emil. That's me.

Here are some skills you should always make use of:
- nix-tooling

Some more information that you need to know about the command-line environment:
- Git is using GPG signing, which requires providing a passphrase when committing. Since that's not something you can do, you'll instead present me with a git command that I can run myself, providing the signature. Whenever you're told to commit, send me the command instead, unless you're told otherwise.
